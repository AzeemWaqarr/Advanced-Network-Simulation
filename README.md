# Advanced-Network-Simulation
This project presents an advanced network simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer, implementing multiple routing protocols (OSPF, RIP, EIGRP) to showcase real-world networking scenarios. The topology consists of interconnected routers, switches, and end devices, configured with appropriate IP addressing, subnetting, and routing mechanisms.
