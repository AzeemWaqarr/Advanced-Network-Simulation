# 🌐 Advanced Network Simulation  

This repository contains a **complex network topology** designed in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, demonstrating multiple **routing protocols**, structured **IP addressing**, and real-world network configurations.

## 📌 Project Overview  

✅ **Multiple Routing Protocols** (OSPF, RIP, EIGRP)  
✅ **Subnetting & IP Address Allocation**  
✅ **Network Segmentation & VLAN Implementation**  
✅ **DHCP & Static Addressing Configurations**  
✅ **Server Configurations (DNS, Web, TFTP, Data Storage)**

## 🏛 Network Topology  

The project simulates a real-world **enterprise network**, including:  

🔹 **Core, Distribution, and Access Layer Networking**  
🔹 **Routers Configured with OSPF, RIP, and EIGRP Protocols**  
🔹 **Multiple Subnetworks for Efficient Traffic Management**  
🔹 **PCs, Laptops, and Servers Interconnected Across VLANs**  
🔹 **Dynamic and Static IP Assignment Using DHCP & Manual Allocation**

## 🚀 How to Use  

### **1️⃣ Open the Project in Cisco Packet Tracer**  
1. Install **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Version XX or later).  
2. Open the `21I-0679.pkt` file to load the network topology.  

### **2️⃣ View the Network Configuration**  
- Check **router configurations** for OSPF, RIP, and EIGRP setups.  
- Open **PCs and Servers** to verify IP assignments.  
- Review the **IP Addressing Document** for subnet details.  

### **3️⃣ Simulate & Test the Network**  
- Run **ping tests** between different devices.  
- Verify **route tables** to ensure proper packet forwarding.  
- Test **DHCP, DNS, and Web Services** on configured servers.
